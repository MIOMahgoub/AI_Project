 ### Hand Control “HC” Car

 This is the Repository for Group 21. Our Group consists of: 

- Muhammad Mahgoub
- Gabriel Villanueva
- Ivebens Eliacin
- Jose Caraballo
- Jose Olascoaga

# Project Overview: 
  The overall objective of our project was to create a robotic car that was entirely controlled by the user's hands. This was completely done by using 
  a pre-trained dataset found in the GitHub repo named ![hand-gesture-recognition-mediapipe](https://github.com/kinivi/hand-gesture-recognition-mediapipe). With this repo, we
  use a Raspberry Pi 5 that was able to run the model, detect the user's hand gestures, and send commands over to the robotic car that had a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W. The Pi Zero would 
  then do its movements based on the information that was collected from the lidar 

   





clearly explains your project setup, dependencies, and how to run the code.

All relevant scripts, models, and datasets (or dataset links) are properly organized and uploaded.

The repository link is working and does not require any special permissions or authentication.

If your project includes large files or trained models that exceed GitHub’s upload limits, provide a Google Drive or other cloud storage link in the README with access enabled for viewing/downloading.
