clearly explains your project setup, dependencies, and how to run the code.

All relevant scripts, models, and datasets (or dataset links) are properly organized and uploaded.

The repository link is working and does not require any special permissions or authentication.

If your project includes large files or trained models that exceed GitHub’s upload limits, provide a Google Drive or other cloud storage link in the README with access enabled for viewing/downloading.
